🤖 Enhanced Agent Workflow System with Scientific Framework

=====================🧠 SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK FOR AGENT ROLES=====================
Based on established cognitive science and problem-solving research:

🎭 INFORMATION COLLECTOR
   🧩 Cognitive Dimensions: ['knowledge_acquisition']
   🔄 Problem-Solving Stages: ['understand']
   //below 2 lines are not necessary, remove the 2 lines from other roles as well
   ⚙️  Processing Type: Bottom-up processing
   📚 Research Basis: Based on Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli & Card, 1999) - optimal information seeking strategies

🎭 PATTERN ANALYZER
   🧩 Cognitive Dimensions: ['analysis']
   🔄 Problem-Solving Stages: ['understand', 'devise']
   ⚙️  Processing Type: Analytical processing
   📚 Research Basis: Based on Dual Process Theory (Kahneman, 2011) - systematic, deliberate analysis

🎭 KNOWLEDGE SYNTHESIZER
   🧩 Cognitive Dimensions: ['synthesis']
   🔄 Problem-Solving Stages: ['devise', 'carry_out']
   ⚙️  Processing Type: Creative synthesis
   📚 Research Basis: Based on Creative Problem Solving (Osborn, 1953; Parnes, 1967) - combining disparate elements

🎭 QUALITY VALIDATOR
   🧩 Cognitive Dimensions: ['metacognition']
   🔄 Problem-Solving Stages: ['look_back']
   ⚙️  Processing Type: Error detection and correction
   📚 Research Basis: Based on Metacognitive Theory (Flavell, 1976) - monitoring and controlling cognitive processes

🎭 ADAPTIVE COMMUNICATOR
   🧩 Cognitive Dimensions: ['communication']
   🔄 Problem-Solving Stages: ['carry_out']
   ⚙️  Processing Type: Audience-adaptive processing
   📚 Research Basis: Based on Communication Accommodation Theory (Giles et al., 1991) - adapting message to audience

//no need to explain it every time you run, I already know it from source code
🔬 OPTIMALITY EVIDENCE:
• Covers all stages of Polya's problem-solving framework
• Maps to distinct cognitive dimensions from Bloom's Taxonomy
• Balances convergent and divergent thinking processes
• Includes metacognitive monitoring (essential for quality)
• Addresses communication theory for output effectiveness
